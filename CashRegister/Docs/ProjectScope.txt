Scope

Design and implement in C# a grocery store cash register.

		Given a number of items you will be required to calculate the total bill.

		Items are charged for in a couple of different ways:

		•	A given price for each item, eg. Boxes of Cheerios are $6.99 each
		•	A given price by weight, eg. Apples are $2.49 per pound
		•	Items can go on sale where you might receive bulk discounts, eg. Buy two get one free sales, Buy four get one free
		•	Coupons are available to get money off the bill when the total amount is above a threshold, eg.$5 off when you spend $100 or more

		The code should include a set of unit tests.
